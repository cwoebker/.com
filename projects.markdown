### Anigmo ###

##### Early-Stage #####

A general artificial intelligence library for abstract board games.
Makes it easy to play games against computer opponents.

{ [anigmo.org](http://anigmo.org) }

Or jump to the games right away:

{ [play.anigmo.org](http://play.anigmo.org) }

All games make use of this library. I still have to work
some things out and then I will make everything open source with a documentation
and everything.

### Como: Batteries Complete ###

Como is a simple tool that runs on your computer and automatically collects information about your battery. It uploads this data anonymously to a nice webapp where you can check everything out.

Check out the code: [cwoebker/como](http://github.com/cwoebker/como).
