[`pen`](https://github.com/cwoebker/pen) is a minimalistic not taking app for the command line.

## What is this? ##

With pen you can have notes everywhere. At least on every unix machine.
What makes it special is that it is 'only' a command line application.
Therefore you can even run it on a server.
Pen has a minimalistic interface and notes can be added and grouped in a simple manner.

## Installation

It's as simple as that:

`$ pip install penpal`

Unfortunately pen was already taken.

## Usage

`pen all` - List all notes recursively.

`pen create <list>` - Create a list.

`pen delete <list> (<note>)` - Delete a list or note.

`pen help` - Displays pen help

`pen help <command>` - Displays help for a command.

## Advanced

`pen` stores all its data (with zlib compression) in the file `~/.pen`.
You are free to do whatever you want with the data in that file,
its yours after all.

You can also change the path of the storage file:

`pen path <new_path>` - Either prints the current storage path or sets a new one.

So go out there and hack some code!

## Features ##

- Minimalistic and simple note editor.
- Automatic saving when closed.
- Create lists to group notes.
- Put the storage file wherever you want. (Supports Dropbox & co)
