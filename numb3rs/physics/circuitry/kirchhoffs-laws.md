Euler's Formula is one of the most important formula's in mathematics since it allows the simplification of many different ideas.

## Background

* Gustav Kirchhoff:
  * Born 12 March 1824
    * Koenigsberg, Kingdom of Prussia
    * Today: Koenigsberg, Germany
  * Death 17 October 1887
    * Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia
    * Today: Berlin, Germany
  * German physicist
  * best known for:
    * Kirchoff's Laws
    * black body radiation
    * Bunsen-Kirchhoff Award
      * named after him and colleague, Robert Bunsen

## Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)

Conversation of electric charge leads to the following:

* At any node (junction) in an electrical circuit
    * the sum of currents flowing into the node equals the sum of the currents flowing out of that node
    * the sum of all current meeting at that point will be `\(0\)`

Since current is either positive or negative it can be stated that:

`\[
\sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0
\]`

`\(n\)` is the total number of branches where currents flow either towrds or away from the node.
The current may also be complex:

`\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \tilde{I}_k = 0
\]`

Since current is just charge per second the conversation of charge can be applied to current.

## Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)

Conversation of Energy leads to the following:

* The sum of electrical potential differences (voltage) around any closed circuit is `\(0\)`

Just like in the `KCL` it can be stated that:

`\[
\sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0
\]`

`\(n\)` equals the total number of voltages meaured.
The voltages may also be complex:

`\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \tilde{V}_k = 0
\]`
