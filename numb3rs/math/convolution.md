Convolution

## The Idea

The convolution of `\(f\)` and `\(g\)` is written `\(f * g\)`. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted. 
Therefore its a special kind of integral transform:

`\[
(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\, g(t - \tau)\, d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t-\tau)\, g(\tau)\, d\tau \text{(by commutativity)}
\]`
